Description: Provides utility functions for R development including chunking
    algorithms for RAM management and package development utilities. The chunking
    functionality manages RAM usage by writing chunks of data to disk, allowing
    processing of large datasets that don't fit in memory. The package development
    utilities include Makefile templates, error handling helpers, and workflow tools.
